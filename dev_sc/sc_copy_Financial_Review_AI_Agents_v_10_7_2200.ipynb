    "4. **Recent News**: Gather latest news, earnings reports, and analyst coverage\n",
    "5. **Market Context**: Check broader market conditions, sector performance\n",
    "6. **Peer Comparison**: Compare key metrics against 2-3 competitors\n",
    "7. **Technical Analysis**: Get recent price action, trends, and key levels\n",
    "8. **Analyst Sentiment**: Collect analyst ratings, price targets, and recommendations\n",
